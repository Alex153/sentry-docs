`sentry.init()` will return you a guard that when freed, will prevent process exit until all events have been sent (within a timeout):

```rust
let _guard = sentry::init(("___PUBLIC_DSN___", sentry::ClientOptions {
    release: Some("my-project-name@2.3.12".into()),
    ..Default::default()
}));
```
