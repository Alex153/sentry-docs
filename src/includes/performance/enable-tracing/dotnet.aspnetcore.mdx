To get started automatically sending traces you must enable tracing.
You can do that by enabling a tracing sample rate. This can be done through the `appsettings.json`:

```json {tabTitle:appsettings.json}
{
  "Sentry": {
    "TraceSampleRate": "1.0"
  }
}
```

Or programatically, if that's how you're configuring Sentry for ASP.NET Core:


```csharp {tabTitle:Startup.cs}
.UseSentry(o =>
{
  ...
  o.TraceSampleRate = 1.0; // Adjust this as needed, 1.0 (100%) might be too much.
})
```
